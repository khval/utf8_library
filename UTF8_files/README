This README should be deleted. IDLTool generated it for you.

These files where generated automatically by IDLTool, and ideally they will
compile out of the box, possibly with a few minimal changes. These changes are:

- The file "Makefile" contains a few comments that should help you to 
  customize it to your liking. Most notably, you should uncomment the 
  CROSS_COMPILE if you are crosscompiling under an alien OS.
  Also make sure tho check DEBUG, LINK and CFLAGS.

- The file "init.c" contains the complete init code of your library. The only
  Assumption it makes (which might not be true, though) are that the Library base
  structure contains the field "SegList". This field is used to store the DOS seglist
  that the system uses to keep track of the memory occupied by your library. It needs
  to be returned on Expunge. The skeleton code already takes care of that. 
  If the field is named differently, you need to edit "init.c".

- For each of your libraries interfaces, a separate directory has been created that
  contains a single file for each function in that interface. The functions are all
  created to be completely empty (and return a NULL value if they have a return value).
  In addition they output a message to the Debug log via IExec::DebugPrintF stating their
  unimplemented state, so that you can watch the debug output to see if you forgot 
  some function.


Some of the files contain comments with additional hints on what can be customized. 
Don't hesitate to throw away what you don't need.

Before starting to compile, make sure to do a single "make revision" to create the
Revision file, or the build will fail with a missing #include. Also, the makefile
might not contain dependencies, so make sure to either add them manually, or make 
sure that you always compile all relevant files (Future versions of IDLTool might
generate these dependencies)
